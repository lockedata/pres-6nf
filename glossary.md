# Glossary

- **anchor** an entity
- **assertion** presenting a posit at a certain point in time 
- **attribute** something about an entity or interaction
- **bitemporal** tracks when values changed and when the value change was asserted
- **change** when an value is no longer the same as it's previous recorded value
- **changing time** when a value is known to have changed
- **closed interval** there is both a start and an end date
- **concurrent-temporal** tracks when values changed and when the value change was asserted, and by multiple positors
- **concurrent–reliance–temporal** values are tracked as to when they happened, by multiple positors, and when a reliability of an assertion occurred
- **correction** a simultaneous retraction of a posit and a new assertion occurs
- **decisiveness** values are assumed to be reliable so only one variation of an assertion can hold
- **descriptor** a longhand label
- **ensemble** an entity and its attributes
- **happening time** when something occurred
- **historized** previous values are retained
- **indecisiveness** values are assumed to be unreliable so multiple variations of an assertion can hold
- **knot** a list of distinct values an attribute can take
- **mnemonic** a shorthand label
- **open interval** there is no end date
- **posit** one or more statements that made at a specific point in time
- **positing time** when a posit was asserted
- **positor** a person or system asserting a posit
- **reassertion** making the same posit statement at a later point in time
- **recording time** when a value was written down
- **reliability** how likely a value is believed to true
- **restatement** is a posit being the same at a later point in time
- **retraction** when a posit is now considered completely unreliable
- **revaluation** adjusting the reliability of a posit statement at a later point in time
- **sisula** the utility for converting an anchor model representation into various output formats
- **static** only the latest value is retained
- **table elimination** the database determining that joining a table in a query is unnecessary based on what is requested in the query
- **tie** an interaction between two or more entities
- **uni-temporal** values are tracked as to when they happened
